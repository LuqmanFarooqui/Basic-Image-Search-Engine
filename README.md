# Image-Search-Engine
This MATLAB code is the implementation of a mini image search engine.

### Instructions

- The code requires you to give the location of the dataset of images within which you want to search. Provide this location in the second line of the code. 
- The code assumes that the image you want to search similiar images for in the dataset, is the first image in the dataset itself. Hence, have your query image's file name such that it is the first in the dataset, or you can adjust which image to be taken in the 9th line of code. Alternatively, you can provide the location of the image manually by entering it in a variable.

### Notes

- The threshold value has been set to 0.680. You may change it and see which value gives you better results - let me know in the comments section !
- You will see the top 3 image results if at all 3 images satisfy the threshold value.
